# NLP Feedback Classification System

## Overview

This project implements a professional Natural Language Processing (NLP) pipeline for analyzing textual feedback in educational and organizational environments.

The system is designed to support:

- Binary classification (Positive / Negative)
- Multiclass classification (Negative / Neutral / Positive)
- Survey analytics integration (Likert-scale + text responses)
- Performance scoring (0–100 index)
- Class imbalance handling (class_weight, threshold tuning, SMOTE)
- Model validation and overfitting detection

---

## Business / Institutional Application

This system is adaptable to:

- Student → Teacher evaluations
- Principal → Teacher evaluations
- Teacher self-evaluation
- Employee performance reviews
- Customer feedback analysis

The architecture is replicable across industries.
